. Bytecode is a highly optimized set of instructions designed to be executed by
what is called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is part of the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE)

it is the magic of Bytecode that makes it platform independent.

An important point to be noted is that while JAVA is platform-independent language, the JVM is\
 platform-dependent. Different JVM is designed for different OS and byte code is able to run on different OS.
